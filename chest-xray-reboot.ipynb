    "# Chest X-Ray Images classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Basing on image and patient data we want to classify into one or multiple classes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "We're working on dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data.\n",
    "This NIH Chest X-ray Dataset comprises 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. To create these labels, the authors used Natural Language Processing to text-mine disease classifications from the associated radiological reports. The labels are expected to be >90% accurate and suitable for weakly-supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data limitations:\n",
    "The image labels are NLP extracted so there could be some erroneous labels but the NLP labeling accuracy is estimated to be >90%.\n",
    "Very limited numbers of disease region bounding boxes (See BBox_list_2017.csv)\n",
    "Chest x-ray radiology reports are not anticipated to be publicly shared. Parties who use this public dataset are encouraged to share their “updated” image labels and/or new bounding boxes in their own studied later, maybe through manual annotation\n",
    "### Class descriptions\n",
    "There are 15 classes (14 diseases, and one for \"No findings\"). Images can be classified as \"No findings\" or one or more disease classes:\n",
